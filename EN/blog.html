            <p class="txsec1">Sodium bisulphite or sodium hydrogen sulphite, whose formula is NaHSO3, is an inorganic salt solution. It is a moderately reducing agent and can release sulfur dioxide when coming in contact with air. When it is disposed of incorrectly, i.e. without neutralization, it can contaminate soil, water and even living beings in the environment...</p>

            <p class="txsec2">Demineralized water, also known as deionized water, is characterized by its purity, being free of minerals, ions and heavy metals. It is often used in industrial equipment and is an ingredient in the manufacture of beverages, food and cosmetics. It's worth noting that although it is pure, it is unfit for consumption. In addition to not quenching your thirst, it is also useless for the body, as it lacks the mineral salts necessary for the maintenance and balance of our organism...</p>

As a result, a large amount of liquid waste called industrial effluents is generated.
