            Water is an essential raw material in industry and its use is present in most of these processes. As a result, a large amount of liquid waste called industrial effluents is generated. It is important to note that this waste concentrates a large quantity of chemical elements and contaminants, which vary according to the industrial segment in which they were used.
            <br><br>
            Due to the accumulation of pollutants contained in this waste, effluent should not be disposed of directly into the environment, as it can contaminate the soil and the surrounding environment. In general, there are public organizations responsible for overseeing and ensuring that industries fulfill their environmental responsibilities with regard to the disposal of their effluents.
            <br><br>
            In order to carry out effluent treatment, it is first necessary to determine the type of pollutant load and the quantity of contaminants, the water is collected by specialists who analyze the parameters that represent the organic load and the toxic load of the effluent.
            <br><br>
            The effluent treatment process is divided into physical, chemical and biological processes.
            <br><br>
            <b>Physical:</b>A process in which all the organic and inorganic material in colloidal suspension is removed, eliminating the presence of microorganisms by means of sand filtration or membrane processes, this process is mainly used for disinfection including violet radiation.
            <br><br>
            <b>Chemical Process:</b>In this process some chemical elements are used, for example: flocculation agents, pH neutralization, coagulation, disinfection, reduction and oxidation. This makes it possible to remove pollutants through chemical reactions, preserving the mixture of effluents that will be treated in the following processes: chemical clarification, electrocoagulation, precipitation, chlorination for disinfection, ozone oxidation, hexavalent chromium reduction, cyanide oxidation, precipitation of toxic metals and ion exchange.
            <br><br>
            <b>Biological Process::</b>The aim is to remove dissolved and suspended organic material by transforming it into settleable solids and gases. The biological process is divided into stages:
            <br><br>
            <b>Aerobic Process:</b>Using activated sludge and its variants, such as prolonged aeration, facultative aerated lagoons, conventional activated sludge and aerobic aerated lagoons.
            <br><br>
            <b>Facultative Process</b>This process requires the use of biofilms such as biological filters, biocontactors and biodiscs, and some lagoons are also part of this process (photosynthetic and facultative aerated). Biocontactors also have aerobic biological processes;
