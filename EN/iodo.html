            Wastewater treatment is one of the most important sectors within an industry. An adequate infrastructure allows all the waste generated during the processes to be reused in an intelligent and environmentally friendly way.
            <br><br>
            Much is known about the reuse of liquid waste, which has many uses, but the solid part (sludge) from water treatment plants can also be reused.
            <br><br>
            Sludge can be generated by both WWTP and WTP treatment. Most of it is made up of water, the rest being the more solid part, which can be organic or inorganic. To transport this sediment in a less costly way and to reuse it, the sludge needs to be dehydrated. This process also allows water to be reused and reduces the volume of waste, making it easier to transport.
            <br><br>
            One of the ways of carrying out this process is through drying beds. In rectangular tanks, wherein the sludge is received, and the humidity is reduced by draining the free water and evaporating the water released during the drying period. This is a similar process to so-called Sludge Lagoons. This is also a natural process, which consists of disposing of the sludge in lagoons located in reservoirs made on land or in depressions in the terrain. Although both methods are natural, the main difference between them lies in their design, as well as in some construction and operating details.
            <br><br>
            <b>Solar drying:</b>In this process, the wet sludge is placed on a drying bed covered by a greenhouse. The heat from solar radiation combined with mechanized sludge turning stages carries out a natural drying process.
            <br><br>
            <b>Fuel-burning dryers</b>use heat to activate the evaporation of the water contained in the sludge. High temperatures can be transmitted through hot air or gas, steam, hot water or even oil. When the heat produced by any of these elements is transferred to the solids matrix, it causes the water in the sludge to evaporate. As this process releases considerably toxic gases, they must be treated before being emitted into the atmosphere.
